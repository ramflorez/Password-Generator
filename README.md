# Password-Generator
CSS  and JS files were linked to the HTML root file.
The Java Script file was used to create a password generator.
First, I created arrays with the different characters required by the password.
Then, I created functions for the lenght of the password >8 characters, but <129 characters.
Next, I created variables for the confirmation of the types of characters: Lower and upper case, numerical, and special characters.
After this, I entered conditonals for every set of characters required in the passwords adding alerts if one of the requirements is not included.
I also added functions to generate password with local variables for possible, guaranteed and possible character adding a conditional to add the different set of characters to the possible characters upon user input.
A for loop ensure the inlcusion of all types of characters throghout the length of the password.
results were transformed into string.
An addEventListener generates the button.
In the CSS file, I added atributes like font family, color and size, backgrund color, borders, padding, etc to all classes (divs).
