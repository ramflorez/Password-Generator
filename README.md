# Password-Generator
Use of Java Script to create a password generator.
First, I created arrays with the different characters required by the password.
Then, I created functions for the lenght of the password >8 characters, but <129 characters.
Next, I created variables for the types of characters: Lower and upper case, numerical, and special characters.
