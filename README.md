# Password-Generator

HTML,CSS,JS.

ramflorez@yahoo.com

The Java Script file was used to create a password generator.
First, I created arrays with the different characters required by the password.
Then, I created functions for the lenght of the password >8 characters, but <129 characters.
Next, I created variables for the confirmation of the types of characters: Lower and upper case, numerical, and special characters.
After this, I entered conditionals for every set of characters required in the passwords adding alerts for requirements omissions.
I also added functions to generate password with local variables for possible, guaranteed, and possible character.
I also add a conditional that adds the different set of characters to the possible characters chosen upon user input.
A for loop ensure the inclusion of all types of characters throughout the length of the password.
Results were transformed into string.
An addEventListener generates the button.
In the CSS file, I added atributes like font family, color and size, backgrund color, borders, padding, etc to all classes (divs).
